# CS:GO Case

CS:GO case opening 'simulator' written in Solid.js can be easily expanded with more features. Currently it is really easy to add new cases, but you can't open them you can 
just view them.

# Where is it Deployed
You can find it at https://csgocase.netlify.app/, any new push to this repository will trigger the site to be rebuilt.

# Audio Limitations

Currently it's not possible play audio on site load, the user must click somewhere on the page before they can hear the audio for example the case dropping or mouse over cases.
